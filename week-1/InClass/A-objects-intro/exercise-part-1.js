/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

let room = {
    name: "salon",
    square: 25,
    windows: 2,
    balcon: 1,
}

let bici = {
    vendor: "Star",
    type: "MTB",
    size: 27
}

let sofa = {
    vendor: "Ikea",
    price: 300,
    size: "3x"
}

let lamp = {
    type: "led",
    power: 25,
    warrantyDays: 365
}

let pizza = {
    size: "small",
    price: 15
}
